## Task 1: 2D Isocontour Extraction
----------------------------------
1. Ensure that VTK and NumPy are installed before running the script.
2. If executing the script via Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux), make sure you are in the
   same directory as the Python script to properly utilize relative file paths.
3. The input file should also be located in the same directory as the script when using relative paths.
4. If running the script in an IDE such as VS Code or PyCharm, use the built-in terminal.
5. To execute the script, use the following command:
   python task1.py <inputFilePath> <outputFilePath> <isoValue>
6. The extracted contour will be saved to <outputFilePath>.

## Task 2: Volume Rendering
--------------------------
1. Ensure that VTK is installed before running the script.
2. If executing the script via Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux), make sure you are in the
   same directory as the Python script to properly utilize relative file paths.
3. The input file should also be located in the same directory as the script when using relative paths.
4. If running the script in an IDE such as VS Code or PyCharm, use the built-in terminal.
5. To execute the script, use the following command:
   python task2.py <filePath>
6. The program will ask for a (Y/N) input to enable/diable Phong shading. Please not that any invalid
